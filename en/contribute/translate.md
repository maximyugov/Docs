If you speak any languages other than English, you can help translate MODX into your language.

[Translations are managed via CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/project/modx-revolution). 

First create a CrowdIn account if you don't have one, and then start translating.

> Note that your request to join the translation team will need to be approved. This is usually done pretty quickly. 

Updated translations are automatically added to the next MODX release. If any new lexicons need to be translated, you'll receive a notification from CrowdIn.
